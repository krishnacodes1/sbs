            Dear All, We live in an interconnected and complex world that is
            changing at an unprecedented pace. Preparing children to succeed in
            this challenging environment demands a flexible and real world based
            approach to education. Indeed it requires a dynamic school that can
            turn leaning into a life-long journey of enquiry and discovery,
            culminating in knowledge that matters. While academic strength is
            essential to survive children need excellent soft skills,
            communication skills, understanding of global culture and its
            appreciation, a good character , an attitude to be life long learner
            and contribute to the society at large. At PIS we believe that the
            objective education is just not to inform, but also to empower and
            transform. With this philosophy at its core, we have nurt an ideal
            schooling in Jaunpur with international standard and environment
            where each child can learn, thrive and achieve the fuIlest
            potential.
          </p>
          {/* <p class="mb-4">
            At Hi -Kids Pre-School, we believe education is incomplete without
            teaching kindness and happiness and other such positive values.
            Parents prefer us because we teach their children how to be
            compassionate. We nurture goodness. We value happiness. We celebrate
            your child’s unique traits.

            Early childhood education focuses on children’s development during
            ages three to five. While this developmental period should ideally
            focus equally on mental and physical development, in recent decades
            an emphasis has been placed on mental development, creating a
            concurrent de-emphasis on physical development. However, the two
            actually go hand-in-hand and should not be considered two separate
            entities during early childhood development and education

            Education is a shared commitment between dedicated teachers,
            motivated students and enthusiastic parents, with high expectation.
            Today the role of a school is not only to pursue academic excellence
            but motivate and empower its students to be lifelong learners,
            critical thinkers and productive members of an ever- changing global
            society. To mind, education as an idea is just bricks, mortar and
            but about building Character enriching minds and about varied
            experiences that last a lifetime. One of these is “Root” the
            “wings”! The former Offered by parents and the latter by us. At SBS public school,
            each day that unfold is a wonder and miracle. We enjoy this With our
            children reliving and rediscovering the magic of learning.
